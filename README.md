## How to Run

This is a basic webpage using only html, css, javascript.
While there are many ways to run such a site locally.
What I used and would suggest is vscode and the extension Live Server.

1. Clone this project locally
2. Install Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/Download 
3. Go to Extenstions on the left side of vscode and type in Live Server Install
4. Open the Cloned File within vscode
5. Right click the index.html within Explorer tab and click Open with Live Server
